# Operations-Research-Optimization-Modeling-Portfolio
A curated portfolio of Optimization and Operations Research projects built during my coursework at The George Washington University. This repository showcases practical applications of linear programming, network optimization, transportation modeling, sensitivity analysis, and more solved using Python and Gurobi.

This repository showcases my application of **Optimization Modeling and Operations Research** techniques through a comprehensive project completed as part of my graduate coursework at **The George Washington University ‚Äì MS in Business Analytics**.

The goal is to demonstrate **real-world problem-solving using Linear Programming (LP)** and **Gurobi optimization in Python**, reflecting key decision modeling skills relevant to business analytics and data-driven decision-making roles.

## üìÇ Project Overview: Red Brand Canners Optimization Workshop

**Objective:** Maximize profit for a food canning company by optimizing production decisions under supply, demand, quality, and cost constraints using Linear Programming.

The project explores multiple business scenarios and analytical decisions:

### ‚úîÔ∏è Topics Covered
- Linear Programming Model Formulation (Production Optimization)
- Shadow Prices & Sensitivity Analysis
- Procurement Planning under Variable Crop Quality (Sunny/Normal/Poor scenarios)
- Scenario & Expected Value Analysis
- Strategic Advertising Investment Decisions
- Fixed Cost Production Line Activation Decisions

### üõ† Tools Used
- Python (Gurobi, pandas, matplotlib)
- Linear Programming
- Scenario Modeling & Sensitivity Analysis

---

## üìà Key Results & Learnings
- Achieved optimal production strategies and identified key binding constraints.
- Quantified marginal value of resources using shadow prices.
- Recommended optimal tomato procurement quantities under probabilistic outcomes.
- Integrated advertising decisions and fixed costs into the LP framework for managerial insights.
