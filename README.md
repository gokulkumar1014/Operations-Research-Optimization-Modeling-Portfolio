# Operations-Research-Optimization-Modeling-Portfolio
A curated portfolio of Optimization and Operations Research projects built during my coursework at The George Washington University. This repository showcases practical applications of linear programming, network optimization, transportation modeling, sensitivity analysis, and more solved using Python and Gurobi.

This repository showcases my application of **Optimization Modeling and Operations Research** techniques through a comprehensive project completed as part of my graduate coursework at **The George Washington University – MS in Business Analytics**.

The goal is to demonstrate **real-world problem-solving using Linear Programming (LP)** and **Gurobi optimization in Python**, reflecting key decision modeling skills relevant to business analytics and data-driven decision-making roles.
